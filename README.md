### What's happening in that game
Well, the story is just amazing, there are walls ... and you! And these walls are tumbling down.

### How to play that game
Well, I don't know. The lone thing I know is that it has something to do with pressing the Run-button and using the arrow-keys after that.

### How to get it
Use `git clone https://github.com/aculmas/FallDown.git` in the desired directory. Then open it in Greenfoot and assign the images with the name of the classes to the Actors and Worlds. This has to be done once for each class.
